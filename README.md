# Computer-Networks-Final-Project

This final project is based on a central, cloud-based file-sharing server. It is structured on a client/server architecture, so users connect to the server and give it various commands to fulfill, such as upload, download, and many more. This structure also comes with a dedicated Encryption Server that will handle all Encryption needs on the client end. The server also has a dedicated logging system to handle all potential errors due to latency or dropped connections. Finally, there is a server admin-like console that you can use to perform various tasks 
Please install the following modules in the requirements.txt for this to run properly.
